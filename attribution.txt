Other than default packages which comes with npx create-react-app I've used the following packages.

styled-components library for implementing css component wise.
axios for handling API request.
nanoid for generating random integer for passing as key for each component.
antd library for using its component such as Modal , Image preview.
bootstrap css library for using its predefined class.
